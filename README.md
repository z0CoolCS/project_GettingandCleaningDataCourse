# project_GettingandCleaningDataCourse
Final project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course of Johns Hopkins University

This project is splitted in 5 sections:
1. PREPARE ENVIRONMENT: This sections create directories where files will be stored and download and install packages used along the project.
2. GETTING THE DATA: In this sections, all data is download from internet and stored in folders.  
3. INITIALIZING PATH VARIABLES: In this section, path variables pointing to data are created. This makes easier to know where data is stored.  
4. LOADING DATA: This section loads all data from path variables creating data frame variable in local.  
5. DATA WRANGLING: The last but no least section covers all questions requested by the course project. Data frames are merged, splitted, and filters in order to get 2 data frames, one data frame for mean a std variable and another for averaging the previous data frame based on activities.
